<h1 class="post-title">Hello!</h1>

Iâ€™m a **UI Engineer** from France, now living in **Oslo, Norway**. While I mainly worked for startups during my profesional career, I am now employed at **Cisco** and loving it. I specialize in user interfaces for web and mobile apps.

## Here are a few facts about me:

* My wildest project was working at Jolicloud on an [HTML5 operating system for netbooks](https://www.jolicloud.com/jolios), when they were still hype.
* I like organizing technical meetups, I believe that sharing knowledge freely is one of the best aspect of our profession.
* I love obstacle racing, and anything outdoors generally speaking.
