Finally, after **years** of trials and errors, I have finally (re)launched my personal website. I used to have one relatively active in French from 2006 to 2009.

This time, I decided to a publish something (thanks [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)) and iterate from there. As someone wise said:

    Waiting for perfect is never as smart as making progress.
