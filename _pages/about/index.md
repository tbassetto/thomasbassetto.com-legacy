Born in the [South-West Of France](http://blog.frenchtouch-travel.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/magret-de-canard-aux-deux-pommes-1.jpg), I gradually moved North for my education and work. Right now, I live in [Oslo, Norway](http://student.agh.edu.pl/~bwalus/meanwhile_in_norway_nel_frattempo_in_norvegia%20(4).jpg) :)

I am a *UI Engineer*, with a focus on Web Technologies, working at [Cisco](http://www.cisco.com). I am a [Google Developer Expert Web Technologies](https://developers.google.com/experts/) since July 2015.

I worked on an HTML5 Operating System ([Joli OS](https://www.jolicloud.com/jolios), née Jolicloud), **PhoneGap** apps, **Smart TVs** apps, **Spotify** and **Deezer** apps. All have in common to be based on **Open Web Technologies**.

I also have experience giving technical talks (at [Paris Web](http://www.paris-web.fr/2013/ateliers/les-outils-pour-developpeurs-inclus-dans-les-navigateurs-web.php), [SUd Web](http://sudweb.fr/2012/talk/lopen-web-en-tant-que-pierre-angulaire-du-developpement-multi-objets/), [GDG DevFest Oslo](http://www.meetup.com/GDGOslo/events/213624092/), etc.) and organizing them ([ParisJS](http://parisjs.org), [PhoneGap Paris](http://www.meetup.com/PhoneGap-Paris/), [Paris Hackers](http://parishackers.org/), [dotJS](http://www.dotjs.io/), [Framsia](http://www.meetup.com/framsia/), etc.).

While working in small startups, my responsibilities often include product design and customer support, which I also enjoy doing. I started a job at Cisco late 2015 and can’t wait to discover what it is like to work for a big company!
